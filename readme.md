# PDF Question Answering app using LangChain

A question-answering demo using Astra DB and LangChain, powered by Vector Search

This project was created to work with LangChain, CassandraDB, and AstraDB to develop a PDF question-answering app.


Here I provide a PDF file as an input, which will be divided into small text chunks to create a text vector using OPENAI text embedding. This all-text vector will be stored in a NoSQL-based AstraDB powered by CassandrasDB for faster vector similarity search with text embedding. So at the end, I provide a question that will be converted into a text vector, and after I perform a similarity search with text embedding, I generate five answers. Out of which, the first is more relevant than the other 4.

### install required library with following command:
pip install -q cassio datasets langchain openai tiktoken
pip install PyPDF2

### Set up
From AstraDB, generate a token and get an API key and DBID. Fill in the below details.

ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN = "Your AstraDB Token"
ASTRA_DB_ID = "Your AstraDB ID"


From openAI generate API key and add below.
OPENAI_API_KEY = "Your open AI API key"

### provide the path of  pdf file/files.
pdfreader = PdfReader('file.pdf')


That's it run your code :)
