Ethereum [ 52], one of the most popular blockchains,\\nsupports the execution of Turing-complete programs known as smart contracts that implement\\ndecentralizedapplications.Smartcontractsonpublicblockchainscanbeexecutedbyanyonewith\\natransaction.Therefore,similarlytomanyotherInternet-basedscenarioswheretheresourcesare\\nshared among (potentially unknown) users, it may be required to restrict their usage to a set of\\ntrustedusersthatdependsonaspecificcontext.Forthisreason,anumberofapproachesforeasily\\nintegratingaccesscontrolfunctionalitiesinEthereumsmartcontracts,suchasOpenZeppelin[ 15,\\n39],have beenproposedin theliterature.\\nTheRole-Based Access Control (RBAC)m o d e l[ 24] is a well known and widely adopted\\nmethod to regulate accesses to resources. In RBAC systems, the owner of a resourcedefines a\\nset ofrolesand associates the right to execute each operation on their resource to one (or even\\nmore)oftheseroles.Whenauserwantstoexecuteanoperationonaresource,theaccessdecision\\nprocess is performed to determine whether such user holds the role requested by the resource\\nowner to perform such operation [ 46]. For instance, in a smart contract access control scenario,\\nwhere the rights to execute smart contracts’ functions must be regulated, the user deploying the\\nsmartcontract(i.e.,theresourceowner)defineswhichrolemustbeheldtohavetherighttoexecute\\nthefunctionsasmartcontractexposes.Thentheresourceownerassociatestotheotherusersone\\n(ormore) rolesamong theones previouslydefined.\\nInordertoinferifunknownusersaretrustedandeligibleforaspecificrole, TrustManagement\\nSystems (TMSs)[4]havebeenintroduced.Tothisaim,Lietal.[ 35]definedthe Role-basedTrust-\\nmanagement (RT ) framework combining the strengths of RBAC and TMS. The RT framework\\nallows its users to issue trust credentials that define, in terms of roles, the trust relations among\\nthem, as well as the rules to infer new trust relations from the existing ones. Hence, in the RT\\nframework, the roles of users are discovered at access request time using search algorithms [14],\\nwhichexploitthetrustcredentialsdefinedbyalltheusers.TheRTframeworkissuitabletoimprove\\nthecurrentstate-of-the-artofaccesscontrolforsmartcontracts,especiallyintrans-organizational\\nscenarios[ 13]whererolesareassignedbymultipleorganizationincollaborationwith,orinbehalf\\nof,thesystemdeployer.\\nIn order to adopt an RT system to regulate the execution of smart contracts’ functions, the RT\\nsystemmustbeimplementedontheblockchainaswell.TheadvantagesofbuildingtheRTsystem\\nontopofablockchainareseveral[ 2,33,53].Theblockchaintakescareofboththestorageandthe\\nprocessing of trust credentials, thus guaranteeing transactions immutability and transparency, as\\nwellasthecorrectevaluationofthetrustcredentialstoinfernewtrustrelations.Consequently,the\\nblockchain-basedRTframeworkbenefitsfromdataandcomputational auditability ,i.e.,anyoneat\\nanymomentcanreadtheavailabletrustcredentials,andcanchecktheresultsobtainedfromtheir\\nprocessing. Auditability is a relevant feature [ 33] because no party should be able to misbehave,\\ne.g.,assigningorrevokingarole,withouttheothersknowingthat,andnopartycanrepudiatethe\\nactionstheyperformed[ 13,15].Moreover,performingtheroleinferenceprocessontheblockchain\\npreventsapotentialmaliciousresourceownertostatefalseclaims,e.g.,denyingarequestedaccess\\neven thoughtherequestinguserholdsthespecifiedrole.\\nIn this respect, in a previous work [ 25], we focused on public and permissionless blockchains\\npresenting DART, an Ethereum implementation of a subset of RT called RT 0. To the best of our\\nknowledge, the RT framework is not supported by any other existing access control systems for\\nsmartcontracts.\\nACMTransactions onInternetTechnology, Vol. 23,No.1,Article 14.Publicationdate:February 2023.L2DART 14:3\\nInDART,thetrustcredentialsdefinedbyusersarestoredandevaluatedontheblockchain.The\\nDARTsmartcontractallowsitsuserstocreatesuchcredentialsimplementingRT 0,andexposesan\\nalgorithm,called backwardsearch algorithm,whichinferstheusershavingaspecificrolefromthe\\nexistingtrustcredentials.Consequently,theblockchainguaranteestheimmutabilityandacorrect\\nprocessingofthetrustcredentialswithouttheneedof trustedintermediaries.\\n1.1 Motivationand Contributions\\nTheimplementationofadecentralizedRTframeworkfullybasedonapublicblockchaincanprove\\nto be a challenge because smart contracts cannot currently perform complex computations on-\\nchain. Indeed, from the experiments we conducted in [ 25] on an access control scenario imple-\\nmentedonEthereum,wefoundoutthatthegasconsumedbytheDARTsmartcontracttofindthe\\nusers holding a given role is very large. In particular, DART overcomes the Ethereum block gas\\nlimit when processing the trust credentials of 20 users belonging to more than 15 organizations\\n(universities in our experiment). This could prevent the deployment of DART in several real use\\ncases,whereconsiderablylarger problemsmustbe takenintoaccount.\\nTo overcome the scalability problem of DART while keeping the auditability and decentraliza-\\ntionofpublicblockchains,inthisarticle,weenhancedDARTmakingitalayer-2systemfollowing\\ntheoff-chaincomputationmodel[ 16],inparticularapplyingtheverifiablecomputationapproach\\n[17]. The new framework, named Layer-2 DecentrAlized Role-based Trust (L2DART) man-\\nagement ,isbasedontheintuitionthatinthisscenariocomputingasolutionoff-chainandverify-\\ningit on theblockchainisconsiderablycheaperthancomputingsuchsolutionon theblockchain.\\nL2DART stores RT 0credentials on a public and permissionless blockchain in the same way\\nas DART. Instead, for what concerns the inference of users’ roles from existing trust credentials,\\nL2DARTrequestsitsuserstorunthebackwardsearchalgorithmoff-chain,i.e.,ontheirpremises,\\nexploiting the credential available on the blockchain.

The goal of\\nlayer-2 models is to reduce the code that on-chain transactions execute making them responsible\\nof connecting an off-chain operation with the blockchain [ 28]. As a consequence, the transaction\\ncost is smaller, more transactionscan be placed in each block and, consequently,the time a trans-\\naction has to wait before being placed in a block could be shorter. The advantages are, therefore,\\nreduced transactions costs and latency, increased transaction throughput, but also increased pri-\\nvacy since not all the transactions are executed on-chain. Similarly, other layer-2 models have\\nbeen designed and developed.

The side-chain model, instead, is designed to connect parallel chains either with an\\nexisting blockchain, for example, in the Plasma project for Ethereum [ 42] (now deprecated [ 21]),\\nor with a brand new blockchain, such as on Cosmos [ 34] and Polkadot [ 51].

Finally, otheroff-chain computation tools are Truebit and ARPA.\\nTruebit[49]isanoff-chainverificationtoolthataimsatovercomingthecomputationallimitations\\nof a decentralized network. In Truebit, a Taskgiver requests a computational heavy task storing\\nan entry in a smart contract, Solversoffer themselves to solve it in exchange of a reward, and\\nVerifierscheck the correctness of the result. ARPA [ 5], instead, is a Multiparty Computation\\n(MPC) network. In an MPC network, a set of nparties, including an adversary, wish to learn the\\noutcome of a function y=f(x1,x2,...,xn)where a participant iknows only their secret input\\nxi, and the outcome ymust be correct [ 12]. The ARPA network is composed of a set of nodes\\nperforming secured and privacy preserving computation in a MPC fashion, communicating with\\na blockchain through a proxy smart contract that stores ARPA computation requests.

L2DART is an enhancement of a previous system, DART [ 25], which\\nimplements the RT0framework entirely on the blockchain, but it overcomes the Ethereum gas\\nlimit already when the number of trust credentials in a policy is relatively low, thus being not\\nusable in real scenarios.

Theoretically, DART also satisfies the property P2 because it allows anyone\\nto prove that Alice holds the role EPapers .studentMember since the backward search algorithm\\nis implemented by the DART smart contract as well. However, this computation requires high\\nfees overcoming the Ethereum block gas limit even with simple policies (see the experiments in\\nSection5.1, Test Scenario A), thus not satisfying the property P3, nor P2 in practice. Moreover,\\nthe backward search algorithm finds all the users holding the role EPapers .studentMember , in-\\nformation that Alice does not need to compute, and therefore to pay for being computed on the\\nblockchain. Alternatively, the forward search algorithm, which computes all the roles of a princi-\\npal [14], could be used, but it has the same issues of the backward search algorithm, since (i) it\\ncomputesmoresolutionsthantherequiredone,and(ii)itneedshighfeestosearchforallthesolu-\\ntionson-chain.Inbothcases,theextrasolutionsreturnedbythealgorithmscouldnotbecachedto\\navoid future invocation of the algorithms. As a matter of fact, policies are dynamic because exist-\\ningcredentialscouldberemoved,whilenewcredentialscouldbeadded.Consequentlyasolution\\ncomputedattime T1maynotbevalidanymoreattime T2,whereT2>T1,becausethesetofvalid\\ncredentialsinthepolicycouldbechanged.Inthisrespect,thechoiceofthemostsuitablealgorithm\\ndependsonthespecificproblemtobeaddressed.Forinstance,inapolicydescribingaweboftrust\\nscenario (see the experiments in Section 5.1, Scenario B), a principal Eve trusts another principal\\nif the latter holds the role Eve.trust. In this scenario, Eve might want to know all the principals\\nshetrusts,i.e.,alltheprincipalshavingtherole Eve.trustinthepolicy.Inthiscase,thebackward\\nsearch algorithm provides the answer to this query. Alternatively, in the same scenario, a princi-\\npal, say Alice, who wants to know all the other principals piwho trust her, needs to discover all\\ntherolespi.trustsheholdsaccordingtothepolicy.Inthiscase,theforwardsearchalgorithmpro-\\nvidesAlicewiththeanswertothisquery.Instead,intheaccesscontrolscenario,aprincipalmust\\nhave a given role to be authorized to invoke a given function of a given smart contract.

Since this section is\\naimed at comparing the cost of executing DART and L2DART on the blockchain, in the follow-\\ning, we focus on the L2DART Solidity implementation details that impact the most the gas cost.\\nIn Solidity, dynamic data structures must be stored in the persistent memory of a smart contract,\\ncalledstorage.Instead,staticdatastructurescanbememorizedinthevolatilememory,called mem-\\nory. The cost of writing a data structure in storageis significantly higher than the cost of writing\\nthe same data structure in memory[52]. In DART, the backward search algorithm is executed on\\nthe blockchain. Since this algorithm requires to build the proof graph, whose size is unknown in\\nACM Transactions on InternetTechnology, Vol. 23,No. 1,Article 14.Publicationdate:February 2023.14:18 A.De Salve etal.\\nTable 1.

This integer is passed to\\ntheverifyfunction, along with the proof to be verified, and it allows the function to instanti-\\nate an array of fixed size that in Solidity can be stored in memory, thus reducing the amount of\\ngas required. Intuitively, the upper-bound of that integer is the number of simple member cre-\\ndentials inside the proof τpi. Since the smart contract stores the role-expressions and the mem-\\nbers inside Solidity mappings , credentials can be retrieved in O(1). Storage details are described\\nin[25].\\n5.2 Experiments and Comparison\\nThe deployment of the L2DART smart contract has been observed to cost 2,073,852 units of gas,\\nagainst 1,351,216 units of DART. This cost is proportional to the size of the bytecode that is up-\\nloadedontheblockchain.However,werecallthatthisisaone-timecost,whichispaidonlywhen\\nthesmartcontractsaredeployedontheblockchain.Table 1showsthecostingastocreateanew\\nroleand tostoretrustcredentials,whicharecomparableinthetwo implementations.\\nIn the following of the section, we present three test scenarios comparing the cost of finding\\nthe solutions in DART against the cost of verifying them in L2DART. To simplify the description,\\nwe use the term ONchainBackwardSearch to identify the backward search algorithm executed on-\\nchainbyDART.\\n5.2.1 Test Scenario A: Access Control.

For example, the\\naverage cost of executing the verifyfunction on a single proof in the case of 6 nStudentMem-\\nbersand 6Universities is 82.492 units of gas, with a variance of 2.67 units of gas. The cost is al-\\nmost constant because for each principal the set of credentials in the proof to demonstrate the\\nroleEPapers .studentMember doesnotdependonthenumberofuniversitiesorstudentmembers\\npresentinthepolicy.\\nDiscussion of the results: The tests show the cost to verify the proofs of the solutions com-\\nputed off-chain is much lower than finding them directly on-chain, especially if the use case\\nACM Transactions on InternetTechnology, Vol. 23,No. 1,Article 14.Publicationdate:February 2023.14:20 A.De Salve etal.\\nrequires to verify a single solution.

Finally, we delve into the underlying causes of the variations in gas consumed\\nbytheverifyfunctiononaproofrelatedtothe OFFchainBackwardSearch (i.e.,seeFigures 9(c) and\\n11(c)). In particular, we investigate the source of these small variations by using Sol-Profiler,2a\\nlibraryprovidingline-by-linegasusageofsoliditysmartcontracts.Theprofilerresultsgenerated\\nby the tool reveal that such variations in gas are due to the functions’ arguments allocated in the\\nCalldata area.

L2DART implements the off-chain\\ncomputation mode: It outsources the heavy execution task, the computation of the members of a\\nrole, to a node external the blockchain while the data, i.e., the policy, is entirely stored on-chain.\\nTheL2DARTapproachalsocomplieswiththeverifiablecomputationprotocol[ 16]:(i)L2DARTis\\nnon-interactive,i.e.,itrequiresonlyonemessage,theproof,fromtheProver(Alice)totheVerifier\\n(e.g., the ERC20 SC in Figure 6); (ii) the verification of a solution is much cheaper compared to\\ncompute it with the backward search algorithm; (iii) L2DART does not have any strong security\\nassumptions on the Prover, since it is assumed to be untrusted, while the Verifier is trusted being\\nimplemented on the blockchain; (iv) since all the data are on the blockchain, no private inputs\\nare required, this particular implementation of L2DART does not need zero-knowledge proper-\\nties. Moreover, we derive that L2DART ensures P1, Data auditability, because the policy is stored\\non-chain; it ensures P2, Computational auditability, because it is possible to dispute the off-chain\\nmodule about the correctness of the results; it ensures P3, Affordable Fees, because storing the\\nroles and credentials, and the on-chain proof verifications are cheap in terms of gas in our exper-\\niments. In particular, the complexity of the code of the backward search algorithm is cubic with\\nrespect to the number of credentials in a policy [ 36], while the complexity of the proof verifica-\\ntion algorithm is linear with respect to the number of credentials in the proof. The proof length\\ndepends on the policy and, due to the activation of the monitors I_Monitor andL_Monitor (see\\nSection2.2.3), a subset of credentials of the policy could be replicated in the proof. As a result,\\nthe number of credentials in the proof might be larger than the number of credentials in the pol-\\nicy. On the other hand, the verification algorithm iterates over the credentials of the proof, and\\neach step is computationally light, because it simply applies the rule π()to one credential of the\\nproof,as describedin Section 4.3.Moreover,we noticethat,in general,a proofdoes not necessar-\\nily contain all the credentials in the policy. For instance, if we take into account the example of\\nthe Test scenario A shown in Section 5.2.1, the length of the proof required to prove that Alice\\nholdstherole Epapers.studentMember isconstant,i.e.,itconsistsofsixcredentials(seeFigure 7),\\nregardlessofthenumberofstudentsandofuniversities,i.e.,ofthecredentialsrepresentingthem,\\ninthepolicy(seeSection 2.2.4).ThesameappliesforthetestscenarioC(seeSection 5.2.3).Inthe\\nexampledescribedbytheTestscenarioB(seeSection 5.2.2),whosepolicyPtrustrepresentsatrust\\nnetwork, the length of a proof depends on the length lof the trust chain that connects the two\\nprincipals.Indeed,aproofincludes lcredentialsoftypeT1,and l−1copiesofacredentialoftype\\nT2. Hence, the length of a proof is about twice the length of the trust chain, and the length of the\\nlatter is always less than the length of the policy by construction of Ptrust. For instance, in the\\ntrust network shown in Figure 10(a), the trust chain between PeandPainvolves four principals\\nincluding Pa, i.e.,l=4. In this case, the length of the proof τPa(shown in Section 5.2.2)i s7b e -\\ncause it refers to a trust chain with l=4,and the credential T2.4 is replicated 3 times, while the\\npolicyhas12credentials.Finally,wealsoobservethat,sincethecurrentmostpopularblockchains\\nACM Transactions on InternetTechnology, Vol. 23,No. 1,Article 14.Publicationdate:February 2023.14:24 A.De Salve etal.\\nimpose constraints on the amount of computation that a smart contract can use in a transaction,\\nthe comparison among the backward search and the proof verification algorithms must take into\\naccountsuchconstraintsthatlimitthemaximum numberofcredentialsthatsuchalgorithmscan\\nprocess. In this respect, the experiments, we conducted in Section 5.2, have shown that, within\\nthese limits, in the selected scenarios the cost of computing the solutions is always considerably\\nlargerthanthecostof verifyingeven alltherelatedproofs.\\nSecurity analysis. In order to analyze the security of the proposed system, we consider the sce-\\nnarioofFigure 6whereEpapersdeploysasmartcontract EPapersERC20SC whosefunctionscanbe\\nexecutedonlybyusershavingtherole Epapers.studentMember accordingtothepolicy PEPapers\\nstoredby the on-chain module. Hence, thesmart contract EPapers ERC20 SC requiresas input pa-\\nrameter a proof τproving that the user invoking it holds the role Epapers.studentMember ,a n d\\nit calls the verifyfunction of the L2DART on-chain module in order to validate such proof. In\\nparticular, the on-chain module computes the role granted by the proof τ,a n dEPapers ERC20 SC\\nchecksthatsuchroleisequalto Epapers.studentMember andthatitisgrantedtotheuserwhois\\ninvoking EPapers ERC20 SC .\\nIn our scenario, Aliceis a user who would like to exploit the functions of the smart contract\\nEPapers ERC20 SC .Alicemust provide to EPapers ERC20 SC ap r o o fτ(normally generated by\\nthe off-chain module) which grants her the role Epapers.studentMember according to the policy\\nPEPapers.BothEpapersandAlice,aswellastheotherparticipantsofthesystem,areabletointeract\\nwiththeon-chainmodulewhichistrustedsinceitisdeployedonapublicblockchain.Instead,the\\noff-chain module is an untrusted component, since it is executed on the local device of Alice.A s\\namatterof fact, Alicecouldaltertheoff-chaincomponent(oreven useranothertool)togenerate\\nmalicious proofs. Therefore, the participants of the system can behave maliciously by generating\\nthefollowingattacks.\\n—Attack 1: Alicetries to execute the smart contract EPapers ERC20 SC submitting\\na valid proof that, however, does not grant her the role Epapers.studentMember .\\nThe attack is conducted as follows. Alicesends toEPapers ERC20 SC ’s smart contract a cor-\\nrect proof τproving, however, that Aliceholds the role Epapers.staf fMember (instead of\\nEpapers.studentMember ).EPapersERC20SC ’ssmartcontractcallsthe verifyfunctionofthe\\non-chainmoduletoverify τwithrespecttothecurrentpolicy PEPapers.Theverifyfunction\\nnavigates the credentials of the policy and returns that τproves that Aliceholds the role\\nEpapers.staf fMember .

Consequently, the smart contract EPapers ERC20\\nSCdoesnotallow theexecutionof thefunctionrequestedby Alice.\\nACMTransactions onInternetTechnology, Vol. 23,No.1,Article 14.Publicationdate:February 2023.L2DART 14:25\\n—Attack 3: Epapers tries to deny the access to the smart contract EPapers ERC20\\nSCtoAlice, although Alicesubmits a correct proof that she holds the role Epa-\\npers.studentMember .The attack is conducted as follows. Alicesubmits to the EPapers\\nERC20 SC ’s smart contract a valid proof τthat she holds the role Epapers.studentMember\\naccording to the current policy, which can be verified by using the verify function of the\\non-chain module. The completeness property (see Section 2.2.3) of the proof graph ensures\\nthat ifτholds the role Epapers.studentMember ,then there exists a path in the proof graph\\nthat can be used to prove it. Even if the proof is correct and states that Aliceholds the role\\nEpapers.studentMember ,Epapersunduly denies the execution of the smart contract by Al-\\nice, pretending that the verification process has failed. Because of the auditability property\\nprovided by the framework, Alice(and also other participants) can reliable detect the mis-\\nbehavior of Epapers. Indeed, the code of Epapers’s smart contract, the code of the L2DART\\non-chain module, as well as the current policy are available on the blockchain. In addition,\\nsinceeverycorrectcommunicationbetween Aliceandthesmartcontract EPapersERC20SC\\nresultsinaverifiableandpermanenttransactionstoredontheblockchain,thiswouldserve\\nas aproofto demonstratethestatusof thepolicyat specificpointin time.\\nFinally,anyman-in-the-middleattemptonthechannelusedbytheoff-chainmoduletointeract\\nwith blockchain nodes can be mitigated by using secured channels that provide confidentiality,\\nintegrity, and authenticity. The former property can be provided by Transport Layer Security\\n(TLS) protocols, while the latter two properties are provided by digital signatures. Indeed, any\\nblockchaintransaction,whichwritesdata,is alwaysdigitally signed.\\nDrawbacks. Besides the important advantages discussed in the previous sections, layer-2 tech-\\nnologies also introduce some drawbacks. First of all, blockchain layer-2 technologies rely on re-\\nsourcesthatdonotbenefitfromthesamesecurityanddecentralizationasthelayer1nodespartic-\\nipatingintheblockchainconsensus.Asamatteroffact,off-chainnodesmightbemoresusceptible\\nto attacks, being composed of a much smaller network of nodes or even a single node, and might\\nrequirehighertrustassumptionsdependingonwhohasthegovernanceofsuchnodes.Moreover,\\ndesigning a two layered blockchain application typically requires more effort than designing a\\nblockchainapplication.Furthermore,sometime also the modification of the first layer is required.\\nFor example, to deploy the Lightning Network, Bitcoin had to perform the SegWit soft fork [ 7].\\nFinally, the fact that some blocks could be produced after the off-chain module has read the data\\nneeded for the off-chain computation on the blockchain, but before that the result is verified on\\ntheblockchain,mightintroducearaceconditionproblem.Forinstance,suchraceconditionissue\\ncould affect L2DART. In particular, a L2DART policy Pcould be modified between the time T1\\nwhen a proof τufor a user uthrough the OFFchainBackwardSearch function has been produced\\nand the time T2 >T1 when the proof will be verified to access to a smart contract c. As a conse-\\nquence, the verification of the proof τu, which was valid at time T1 might fail at time T2 and the\\nexecution right could be denied. Although troublesome, denying an access due to these race con-\\nditionsisactuallythecorrectbehavior.Hence,theuserswouldhavetoproduceanewproofwith\\nOFFchainBackwardSearch withtheupdatedpolicy,andtoasktoexecutethesmartcontract cagain\\nby submitting this new proof. However, we note that this problem arises also in a full on-chain\\nimplementation due to a vulnerability called transaction-ordering dependence [37], i.e., when the\\noutcome oftwo transactionsTx1 and Tx2 dependson theirorderinginside ablock.\\n7 RELATEDWORK\\nBlockchain-based access control mechanisms have been applied to IOT [ 3,40], healthcare [ 46],\\nand cloud storage [ 23].

[ 13] propose a challenge-response based implementation of a RBAC in a trans-\\norganizational environment.

However, this approach\\ndoesnotallow usersto make inferenceover attributesand off-chaincomputationis notexecuted\\nbecausepoliciesare evaluatedon-chainbytherelatedsmart contracts.\\nSummarizing, the main similarity among all the approaches listed in Table 2is that they allow\\ntheir users to define their roles and to assign them to other users (in DART and L2DART, using\\nSimple member credentials, see Section 2.2.1), they store the credentials representing the roles\\non the blockchain, and they use them in the access control process to decide whether to grant a\\nprivilegetoauserornot.However,DARTandL2DARTdifferfromtheotherapproachesbecause\\nthey allow their users to define their trust relations through Simple inclusion, Linked inclusion,\\nandIntersectioninclusioncredentials(seeSection 2.2.1).Consequently,theaccesscontrolprocess\\nof DART and L2DART uses both the roles that have been directly assigned to the users, as well\\nas the roles that have been inferred exploiting the trust relations (executing the chain discovery\\nalgorithm, see Section 2.2.3, to perform role inference).

            "ANSWER: \"Layer-2 DART is designed as a layer-2 system that enhances DART by using an off-chain computation model and a verifiable computation approach. Its framework, L2DART, is based on the idea that computing a solution off-chain and verifying it on the blockchain is cheaper than computing it entirely on the blockchain. L2DART stores trust credentials on a public blockchain and uses a backward search algorithm to infer users' roles from these credentials. It also includes an on-chain module and an off-chain module for cost-effective execution and auditability.\"\n",
